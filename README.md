# memory-game

A simulaton of a two player game,where the computer plays both part.
16 pairs of cards (32 cards) are laid face down randomly.
Each card is a coloured shape (e.g. red triangle). There are 4 colours (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and 4 shapes (Square, Circle, Triangle, Oval).
Cards are paired when both their colour and shape are the same (e.g. a red triangle is not a match for a blue triangle).
Players take turns to flip over two cards of their choosing. If they pick a matching pair, they keep both cards. If not, both cards are turned face down again.
The game is over when there are no cards left. The winner is the player with the most cards.
